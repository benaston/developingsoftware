Design Patterns

##Decorator pattern

This is used for two benefits

 - 1. it mitigates a class explosion should there by a large number of variants of a type (coffee, whitecoffee, coffeewithchocolate, whitecoffeewithchocolate)
 - 2. It enables runtime construction of arbitrary combinations of decorated features.
 - testability
 
All developers should sign a core hours agreement (no meetings).

All cards (stories, bugs, tasks) larger than a 1 should have a story kick off to ensure the whole team is abreast of the requiremnt.
